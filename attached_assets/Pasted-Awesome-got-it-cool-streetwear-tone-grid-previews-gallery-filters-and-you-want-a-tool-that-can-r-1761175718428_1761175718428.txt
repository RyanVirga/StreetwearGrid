Awesome—got it: cool streetwear tone, grid previews, gallery filters, and you want a tool that can reuse uploaded logos and pull style from moodboards to produce clean, trendy designs.

Here’s the plan and your copy-pasteable Lovable prompt.

Recommendation for mockup & concept generation (Phase 2)

Use a two-part workflow: Adobe Firefly (via Adobe Express API) + Smartmockups (or Placeit)
	•	Why Firefly?
	•	It supports Brand Kit concepts and handles vector/text/logo overlays well, so you can feed it the client’s logo, color hints from the moodboard, and get on-brand compositions (poster/graphic layouts, print placements) rather than just “artsy” AI.
	•	Style Reference prompts let you steer toward clean, modern streetwear (big type, minimal gradients, grain/noise textures).
	•	Adobe’s commercial safety/IP guardrails are stronger than most, which matters when you’re remixing client logos.
	•	Why Smartmockups/Placeit?
	•	They provide photoreal product mockups at scale (tees, hoodies, hats, totes, mugs, bottles) with API/automation options. You drop in Firefly’s design output (PNG/SVG), and instantly get store-ready product photos from multiple angles.
	•	It’s fast, consistent, and easy to batch.

Flow:
Uploads (logo + moodboard) → Firefly generates 3–6 concept panels (internal only) → Pick 1–2 → Auto-place on blank apparel canvases → Smartmockups renders front/back/alt views.
This gives you trendy concept ideation + realistic product mockups without exposing half-baked art to the client.

Lovable prompt (paste this in)

Project: Streetwear-leaning custom merch request app (US-only)
Audience: Businesses and creators; no anonymous requests
Tone/Style: Cool streetwear, bold type, lots of negative space, editorial grid, big product imagery, minimal color palette (no purple)

Build a mobile-first retail app for custom merch leads. Customers choose products, upload logos/moodboards, specify quantity and deadline, and submit a request. We capture contact info and route the lead by priority. No pricing calculator in v1—quotes go by email.

Goals
	•	Collect all production inputs in one pass (product, quantity, due date, artwork).
	•	Display product cards and a gallery of past work.
	•	Score and email leads to the team (Phase 1).
	•	Prepare hooks for Phase 2 (pricing, payment, automated mockups).

Pages & sections
	1.	Home / Hero
	•	Headline: “Custom streetwear, on your timeline.”
	•	Subcopy: “Tell us what you need, drop your art, and we’ll craft a clean, on-brand look.”
	•	CTAs: “Start a request” (primary), “See past work” (secondary)
	•	Trust: turnaround badges (Standard, Rush), review count, client logos.
	2.	Request Wizard (4 steps, sticky progress)
	•	Step 1: Basics
	•	Product multi-select (tee, collared shirt, hoodie, crewneck, hat, tote, bottle, mug, stickers)
	•	Quantity (supports per-size table toggle), MOQ: 50
	•	Due date (date picker), rush tiers available
	•	Location (ZIP)
	•	Priority selector (radio): Budget, Timeline, Quantity, Repeat customer, Product type, Location
	•	Step 2: Customization
	•	Print methods: screen print, DTG, puffy, embroidery, DTF, sublimation, engraving, patches
	•	Print locations (front, back, sleeve, left chest)
	•	Colorways and size runs
	•	Notes field
	•	Step 3: Uploads & Moodboard
	•	Multi-file uploader with grid previews (JPG, PNG, PDF, plus vector like AI/SVG/EPS; no size cap UI constraint)
	•	Optional Brand Guide upload (fonts, Pantone/hex, logo pack)
	•	Optional links: Pinterest/Drive/Dropbox
	•	Inline tips for best results (transparent PNG/SVG preferred)
	•	Step 4: Contact & Review
	•	Required: name, company, email, phone
	•	Shipping ZIP
	•	Summary of selections; acknowledge MOQ and rush notes
	•	Submit CTA: “Send my request”
	3.	Catalog
	•	Product grid with filters: product type, print method, color, timeline, MOQ.
	•	Card shows big image, short specs, typical turnaround, “Add to request”
	4.	Gallery / Past Work
	•	Grid with filters (product type, print method, color tags)
	•	Case study modal: photos, brief blurb, method, turnaround.
	5.	Thank You / Next Steps
	•	Confirmation, email ETA, ability to add more files post-submit (link), reiterate MOQ and rush options.

Lead routing & scoring (Phase 1)
	•	Inputs: priority choice, deadline, quantity, repeat customer flag, product type, location
	•	Scoring example: Budget +6, Timeline +5, Quantity (≥100) +4, Repeat +4, within-state +2; impossible deadline −6
	•	Tag: Hot/Warm/Cold
	•	Action: email all request data + attachments to a team inbox (Gmail/Outlook). No CRM yet.

Accessibility & UX
	•	Clear labels, inline errors, 44px tap targets, alt text prompts, keyboard-navigable.
	•	Drag-drop uploads with progress and removal.
	•	Sticky stepper with step names.

Visual design
	•	Typeface: Inter (display weights) with Source Sans 3 for body
	•	No purple; use a neutral core with bold accent.
	•	Suggested palette:
	•	Base: Charcoal #111315, Off-white #FAFAF7
	•	Accents: Electric Blue #2F6BFF or Safety Red #E63946 (choose one), Asphalt Gray #4B4F52
	•	Photo style: studio-lit apparel on textured concrete or paper backdrops; subtle grain.

Tech hooks (for later)
	•	Prepare end-points for: pricing calculator, payment capture, and automated mockup generation (Adobe Firefly + Smartmockups).
	•	Store uploads with metadata (filetype, brand kit present, colors extracted).

Empty states & guardrails
	•	If due date < 3 days, show: “Rush required, fees apply.”
	•	If quantity < 50, show explainers and upsell to sample pack.

Production recommendations (Phase 1 MVP)

Stack
	•	Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript for the app
	•	Supabase for auth (email OTP), Postgres (requests, files meta), RLS for per-user files
	•	Supabase Storage (or S3) for uploads; virus scan via webhook (ClamAV/Lambda)
	•	Resend or SendGrid for emailing lead packets to your team inbox (with attachments)
	•	PostHog for funnel analytics (upload success, step drop-offs)
	•	Vercel for hosting; set 10–50MB body limit for file uploads, chunked uploads

Data model (minimal)
	•	requests: id, user_id, company, contact, email, phone, zip, priority_choice, due_date, product_types[], methods[], size_run_json, quantity_total, notes, repeat_customer, location_state, score, tag, created_at
	•	files: id, request_id, type (logo|art|moodboard|brand_guide), path, mime, width/height, colors_json, created_at
	•	gallery_items: id, title, product_type, method, tags[], images[]

Lead email
	•	Compose an HTML email with a clean spec table and embedded thumbnails; attach originals. Subject: NEW REQUEST · {Company} · {Product} · {Qty} · {DueDate}

Form details
	•	Grid preview for uploads with remove/reorder
	•	Vector badge (AI/SVG/EPS) and “Brand Guide attached” indicator
	•	Per-size quantity table (S–XXL) with dynamic total
	•	Friendly inline validations (ZIP, phone)

Security & privacy
	•	RLS: users can only read files they uploaded
	•	Signed URLs for attachments in emails (expire in 7–14 days)
	•	Rate-limit submits; honeypot field to deter bots

SEO/content
	•	Landing page with clear H1, product schema for Catalog cards, alt text on gallery images
	•	FAQ: turnarounds, methods explained, MOQ policy

Analytics KPIs
	•	Start → Submit conversion
	•	Upload success rate
	•	Percent flagged as Rush
	•	Distribution by method/product
